# Traffic-Controler
This repository focuses on traffic monitoring and control using satellite imagery, leveraging deep learning and image processing techniques. The goal is to automatically analyze satellite images to assess traffic density and flow, providing insights that can aid in real-time traffic management and congestion prediction. The project explores the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and segmentation models to identify traffic patterns and classify roads based on traffic conditions. This repository includes code, datasets, and methodologies for training and evaluating models to enhance the accuracy of traffic analysis.
